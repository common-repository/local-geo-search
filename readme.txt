== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I use Local Geo Search on my site? =

If you run a business that serves customers locally, Local Geo Search can be a valuable tool in maximizing your website's visibility on search engines. While the tool itself is powerful, it is only
one piece of a successful SEO plan. We can connect you with a regional team of marketing experts that can help you with an overarching online marketing strategy that leverages Local Geo Search.

= Is the plugin free to use? =

No. Local Geo Search requires an account to use. If you want to see it in action, we can connect you with a marketing team. If you are a marketing company and are interested in leveraging Local Geo Search
for your customers, we offer white label packages for branding and using Local Geo Search as a powerful tool in your SEO for clients.

= How many pages will Local Geo Search create on my site? =

It depends on the plan that you and your marketing team decide is best for your website. In the end, the number of created pages = 1 + ((number of terms) * (number of locations)) + (number of terms) + (number of locations)

= Do the pages that get created look like my site? =

Yes! The Local Geo Search pages use the same theme the rest of your site uses and includes all of the html head tags that your site includes. Like any other page, you can embed videos and images too!

= Can Local Geo Search alone get my website top page results? =

We cannot guarantee top page results for your key terms and locations. Page ranking depends on how competitive your keywords and industry are, and other algorithms. We have seen great results and can make the best suggestions for you to see success.
